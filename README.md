# aoc 2023

My solutions to https://adventofcode.com/2023 .

Mostly written in python, because string parsing is easy here.

### Side-goals for this year

- experiment with new-ish [DAP plugins](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap) as well as [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest/)
- iron out various dotfile/plugin coherence in context of quick begin-to-end python dev
- possibly try send-to-REPL code runners like https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime
- familiarize with the third-party libs that are generally helpful for aoc:
    - `more-itertools`
    - `networkx`
    - `z3-solver`
    - [`portion`](https://pypi.org/project/portion/) (for intervals)
    - [`disjoint-set`](https://pypi.org/project/disjoint-set/)
